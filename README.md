Welcome to my Github page! This Python script is a simple console-based Dice Rolling Simulator that lets users roll different types of dice, including 6-sided, 8-sided, 10-sided, and 12-sided dice. Users can choose to roll 1, 2, or 3 dice at a time, and the results are generated using Python's built-in random module. The program features a main menu for selecting the type of dice, followed by prompts to determine how many dice to roll. After each roll, users are given the option to roll again or exit. This project is great for beginners learning Python, especially for practicing loops, conditionals, functions, and user input handling.
